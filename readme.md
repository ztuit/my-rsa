MY-RSA

Trivially simple implementation of RSA algorithm in Java.

Extended Euclidean Algorithm is used to find the modular multiplicative inverse. A copilot implementation was generated for experiementation - it does not handle every case correctly.

This is a lab, the project doesn't offer any library service to programs.

See the unit test for usage.
